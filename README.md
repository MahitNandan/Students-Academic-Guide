# Students' Academic Companion

The **Students' Academic Companion** is a Python-based application designed for 11th and 12th-grade science students. This project helps students practice chapters in Physics and Chemistry by providing access to theory, assignments, solved examples, mock tests, and a personalized note-taking feature for revision.

## Features
- **Subject Selection**: Choose between Physics and Chemistry.
- **Chapter-Based Resources**: Access content for specific chapters:
  - **Theory**: Study material for each chapter.
  - **Assignments**: Practice problems in PDF format.
  - **Tests**: Mock tests for self-assessment.
  - **Notes**: Dedicated notepad for personalized notes.
- **User Management**: Handles both new and returning users with login functionality.
- **Progress Tracking**: Keeps a record of completed chapters and user notes for effective revision.

## System Requirements
**Hardware**:
- Minimum 256 MB RAM
- 1.5 GHz Processor

**Software**:
- Compatible with:
  - Windows XP
  - Windows 7/8/10 (32-bit and 64-bit)

---

## Limitations
- The current application lacks database integration, so user data is stored in local files.
- The folder containing theory, tests, and assignments can be accessed and modified by any user.
- No online correction of tests and assignments.

---

## Possible Improvements
- Adding database integration for enhanced security and scalability.
- Implementing user authentication for stronger validation.
- Introducing an online test correction and grading system.

---

## Program Code
The full program code is written in Python and uses the following key modules:
- **Tkinter**: For the user interface.
- **OS**: For file and folder operations.

For the complete source code, please refer to the `main.py` file in this repository.
